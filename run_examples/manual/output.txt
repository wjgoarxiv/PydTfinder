INFO Please enter the TEMPERATURE values (K) separated by comma: 283.2, 291.2, 299.7, 302.7
INFO Please enter the PRESSURE values (MPa) separated by comma: 0.310, 0.710, 1.496, 2.241
INFO The input temperature values are:  [283.2, 291.2, 299.7, 302.7] [unit: K]
INFO The input pressure values are:  [0.31, 0.71, 1.5, 2.24] [unit: MPa]
INFO Your desired temperature at 0.31 MPa is 277.00 K (T = 283.20 K - Î”T = 6.20 K)
INFO Your desired temperature at 0.95 MPa is 288.50 K (T = 294.70 K - Î”T = 6.20 K)
INFO Your desired temperature at 1.60 MPa is 294.07 K (T = 300.27 K - Î”T = 6.20 K)
INFO Your desired temperature at 2.24 MPa is 296.50 K (T = 302.70 K - Î”T = 6.20 K)
